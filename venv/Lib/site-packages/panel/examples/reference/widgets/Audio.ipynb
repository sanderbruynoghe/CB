    "The ``Audio`` widget displays an audio player given a local or remote audio file. The widget also allows access and control over the player state including toggling of playing/``paused`` and ``loop`` state, the current ``time``, and the ``volume``. The audio player supports ``ogg``, ``mp3``, and ``wav`` files.\n",

To express interactivity entirely using Javascript without the need for a Python server take a look at the [links user guide](../../user_guide/Param.ipynb).\n",
